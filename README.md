Note: this README was generated using `m2md` and uses syntax dependent on MATLABÂ®'s PUBLISH function. However, it **requires the addition of the keyphrase `%% ENDPUBLISH` after the help/docstring to function**. See the help for the PUBLISH function and the assoiaciated Topic pages for more information on styling. For example, start lines with 1 space to show regular text; 2 spaces for monospaced text; and 3 spaces for actual code. As much as possible, compatibility with both PUBLISH and HELP was maintained. This code is distributed as-is, but is accepting improvements (at least in 2023).
   
# Syntax

```matlab:Code(Display)
m2md(file)
m2md(file, Name, Value)
mdFile = m2md(file,___)
[mdFile,texFile] = m2md(file,___)
```

# Description

`m2md(file)` converts the doctring or help of the specified MATLAB code file to a tex file and then into a Markdown file, using the functionality provided by PUBLISH and LATEX2MARKDOWN. It requires the addition of the keyphrase `%% ENDPUBLISH` after the help/docstring to function.
   

`m2md(file)` converts the specified MATLAB file with options specified by one or more `name,value` pair arguments. For example, you can specify custom options for generating the .tex and .md files, where to output the .tex or .md files, the name of the .md file, or whether to delete the .tex file.
   

`mdFile = m2md(file)` converts the specified MATLAB file and returns the relative path of the resulting .md file. You can use this syntax with any of the input argument combinations in the previous syntaxes.
   

`[mdFile, texFile] = m2md(file)` converts the specified MATLAB file and returns the relative path of the resulting .md file and the full path of the .tex file. You can use this syntax with any of the input argument combinations in the previous syntaxes.
   
# Examples

```matlab:Code(Display)
m2md("m2md");
m2md("m2md", 'texDir', 'tmp', 'mdDir', '.', 'mdFilename', 'README', 'deleteTex', true);
```

# Input Arguments

```matlab:Code(Display)
file - MATLAB file name (character vector | string)
MATLAB file name, specified as a character vector or string. It should *NOT*
include the '.m' extension. *NOTE*: When publishing a file, this will
overwrite existing files in the target folders with the same name as `file`.
```

    
# Name-Value Arguments

```matlab:Code(Display)
texOptions - Options to pass through to PUBLISH (cell array)
Name-Value arguments to be passed through when calling PUBLISH. The default
bevahiour is to set the format to latex and turn off the display and
evaluation of code. These can be changed if desired, but is likely to
significantly harm performance. See the Name-Value Arguemnts of PUBLISH for
more information.
```


```matlab:Code(Display)
mdOptions - Options to pass through to LATEX2MARKDOWN (cell array)
Name-Value arguments to be passed through when calling LATEX2MARKDOWN. Note
that there is currently *NO* option to turn off the Table of Contents - this
is autogenerated by PUBLISH. See the Instructions/docs for LATEX2MARKDOWN /
LIVESCRIPT2MARKDOWN for more information.
```


```matlab:Code(Display)
outputDir - Directory to create the tex and md files (string | character vector)
Output folder to which the tex and md files are saved. If no folder is
specified, these will be output to the default specified by PUBLISH,
`./html`.
```


```matlab:Code(Display)
texDir - Directory to create the tex file only (string | character vector)
Output folder to which the tex file only is saved.
```


```matlab:Code(Display)
mdDir - Directory to create the md file only (string | character vector)
Output folder to which the md file only is saved.
```


```matlab:Code(Display)
mdFilename - Name of the md file (string | character vector)
Output file name to which the md file is saved.
```


```matlab:Code(Display)
deleteTex - Flag to delete tex file (false (deafult) | true)
Whether to delete the intermediary tex file, specified as `true` or `false`.
If the tex file is deleted and its parent folder is empty, the parent folder
will then be deleted too.
```

    
# Output Arguments

```matlab:Code(Display)
mdFile - Relative path to .md file (string | character vector)
The output filepath as generated by LATEX2MARKDOWN.
```


```matlab:Code(Display)
texFile - Full path to .tex file (character vector | string)
The output filepath as generated by PUBLISH.
```

    
# Tips

- In order to demarcate the end of the docstring: create a section entitled ENDPUBLISH (use `%% ENDPUBLISH`) i.e. `%%`, followed by a space, followed by `ENDPUBLISH`.
